Damn.

It's a tragedy.

I thought at the end of episode 12 that Kenny was still in with a chance with Rikaso - despite his failure to make a 
move earlier.

Sadly however at the beginning of episode 13, Rikaso turns him down.

Her explanation on the surface is that they won't make good long term partners and Kenny has decided to leave the house.

I suspect that the reality is however that Kenny lost his chance with Rikaso on the movie night - much earlier.

And he lost his chance with Haruka too at the same time.

At the end of the episode he finally goes for the kiss with confidence - too forcefully if anything.  
But of course he got rejected - it's too late.

There are some basic skills that men must learn.  Kenny needs them.   Without these skills he turned two terrific 
opportunities that were there for the taking into failure.

This episode left a knot in my gut.  

Maybe things will turn around for Kenny in the next episode.  But I doubt it.
